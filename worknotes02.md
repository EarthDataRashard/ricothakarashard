### Dear_M_R_O
I went to lapl central yesterday. I was able to blend in with a crowd of other carts. But today the security gaurd would not let me in! I wanted to work on this book! I learned about [`lseek`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html) and while i got knocked offline android wise after that armed robbery at city hall by the gunman in the playboy back pack. I was learning [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/). I dont understand the concept of what a [stream is at its most basic level yet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STREAMS) except that its a file! So if lseek can let you write directly to a disk theres a possibility i will never miss a [flyby](https://science.nasa.gov/learn/basics-of-space-flight/chapter16-1/) with [the right android](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-rugged-smartphones) 

## Chapter 16: Encounter
### Flyby Operations
All the interplanetary navigation and course corrections accomplished during cruise result in placement of the spacecraft at precisely the correct point, and at the correct time to carry out its encounter observations. A flyby spacecraft has a limited opportunity to gather data. Once it has flown by its target, it cannot return to recover any lost data.
