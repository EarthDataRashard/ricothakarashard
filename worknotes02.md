## Code Refactoring
Good Afternoon MRO. 
Dear Chris, i know you were a Mori Person as well but older and i was brought on like TekSystems so i was mision right away. I remember ppl were talking about using Salt for configuration Management and there is the inhouse system. I mean it all seems attached to the Netapp and that Refurb that happened in the Mission Control Datacenter. I was Told there was cracks in the floor and i thought you all were Mean military people. I was in my head lashing out at my marriage and religious way of life collapsing and worried aobut being chased off. Thanks.

I really enjoyed this section from [Steve Lindstorm](https://dontpaniclabs.com/blog/post/2020/11/11/reflections-on-css-refactoring-by-steve-lindstrom/)

Now i dont know what standards exist if any but this is the type of information i shared with the girls my age from Dance411. The problem is they was teaching a lot of criiminal men and they infiltrated corporate and really hurt atlanta. I was talking to her independantyly and teaching her middleware bc thats where she was getting knixed online. The thing is with the Striptease they have to balance functioning in the daytime affter a nighttime kidnapping and rape. Im not saying every guy that has been in her company is bad. But she has been asking me for a child for about 5 years now. Im afraid and bleeding.

### Dear_M_R_O

I went to lapl central yesterday. I was able to blend in with a crowd of other carts. But today the security gaurd would not let me in! I wanted to work on this book! I learned about [`lseek`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html) and while i got knocked offline android wise after that armed robbery at city hall by the gunman in the playboy back pack. I was learning [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/). I dont understand the concept of what a [stream is at its most basic level yet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STREAMS) except that its a file! So if lseek can let you write directly to a disk theres a possibility i will never miss a [flyby](https://science.nasa.gov/learn/basics-of-space-flight/chapter16-1/) with [the right android](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-rugged-smartphones) 

## Chapter 16: Encounter
### Flyby Operations
All the interplanetary navigation and course corrections accomplished during cruise result in placement of the spacecraft at precisely the correct point, and at the correct time to carry out its encounter observations. A flyby spacecraft has a limited opportunity to gather data. Once it has flown by its target, it cannot return to recover any lost data.[ReadMore](https://science.nasa.gov/learn/basics-of-space-flight/chapter16-1/) [Basics of Spaceflight](https://science.nasa.gov/learn/basics-of-space-flight/)

This book disturbed me at a level bc We need to get a hold on all these courts at least locally in los angeles, I dont know where they will take me and ppl brandish weapons towars me. Normani has been Bullied for years. She was in a Group Called Fifth Harmony. Like Shopping mall music. Normani told me she took the lead in writing this song [WFH-Work From Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GL9JoH4Sws). I dont know where we were romantically but since they are in the StripTease media i got a lot of hate from TAOS during a Pearson Datacenter Migration! "You are having too much fun!" I started Doing the Stand up meetin on my back deck and They said you are having too much fun and Fired me. I was just trying to earn money to come back to Los Angles. About the song since she was at Dance411 the modeing people like gucci tom ford them type of ppl always took over her shoots so its not an IT work from home theme its contruction bc guess what. The Bethalites had to dance with the sisters. I got hurt man!

Anyway im Trying to let you know that since the girls are popular in the adult night life scene im constantly robbed and made to bleed at this point via soft ammo arsnic or anthrax pepper rounds. That may be a for of prosecution for wsomething as simple as downloading an mp3 from archive.org that they dont know is public domain bc the artist has such a reach on the street. ex NickiMinaj.
