# Using BASH ::

The --posix option caught my attention this morning. I wonder how it will effect my approach to [The Unix Programming Environment](https://github.com/tcd/tupe/blob/master/the-unix-programming-environment-kernighan-pike.pdf)... I think i can make bash.md and start chronicling my growth with the shell. It was my first shell. it came bundled with the R[RedHat Linux Version](https://opensource.com/article/16/12/yearbook-linux-test-driving-distros) then carried by [BestBuy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/red-hat-linux-professional-9-0-linux/5537582.p?skuId=5537582). Fedora Core 1 at [Tuscon Unified School District](https://www.tusd1.org/) was my first professional jesture at [using bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html). I always knew that to be a good linux user at work, i have to use it as my primary desktop. Tgat was the settinbg of the time. Windows was important because of the Authentication Schemes  you needed to login. How can i do both? in that era DualBoot. Today it dont matter as much bc most hardware you put your hands on has multithreading and virtualization extensions enabled by default.
