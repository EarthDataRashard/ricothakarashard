# About Normani
Coral, i dropped you off at your moms house for our first date. I need a Face to Face, but she said she wanna move forward. And I work different now. IDK when I will start getting paid but im getting politically settled in Los Angeles. Your Mom... idk i see her from time to time. She dont get in Normani way, so theres always a door to lover her thats open. But Lord help me I dont want you thinking she is worthless. This is the thing. iVF was a big choice and Im baggage or foundation. Wehn girls get older they dont kiss guys l;ike that no more. Normani is in a different stage of life and say she wanna settle down. I just hope im not follwoing SeanBankHead lovenotes and get hurt man. 

We got new Rovers! Imma share more about my Planetary Exploration with you so there can always be something we can relate on

[ASTER Mission](https://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/mission.asp)

ASTER is a cooperative effort between NASA and Japan's Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry (METI), with the collaboration of scientific and industry organizations in both countries. The ASTER instrument provides the next generation in remote sensing imaging capabilities when compared to the older Landsat Thematic Mapper and Japan's JERS-1 OPS scanner. ASTER captures high spatial resolution data in 14 bands, from the visible to the thermal infrared wavelengths, and provides stereo viewing capability for digital elevation model creation. As the "zoom lens" for Terra, ASTER data are used by other Terra and space-borne instruments for validation and calibration.
