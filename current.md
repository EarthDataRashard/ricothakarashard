# contrast()
The contrast() CSS function adjusts the contrast of the input image. Its result is a <filter-function>. The contrast of the result, specified as a <number> or a <percentage>. A value under 100% decreases the contrast, while a value over 100% increases it. A value of 0 or 0% will create an image that is completely gray, while a value of 1 or 100% leaves the input unchanged. Negative values are not allowed. The initial value for interpolation is 1.

The laser may seem bright, but this is due to the long exposure of the picture â€” you can see the stars trailing across the night sky through the open dome indicating the long exposure time. The TOPTICA laser of the observatory is generally dim to the naked eye, depending on how close you are standing to it.
