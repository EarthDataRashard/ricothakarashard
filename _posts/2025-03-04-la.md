Hi KK if thats you, Sharon sister. Eitherway i think you are an awesome Mayor, I was told taht since you in Congress you can fire me... anyway! Can you flip through these images when you get a chance its some important documents like the LA County excerpt on what the [Mayor](#Mayor)'s Jobrole is and her Hiring and Firing abilities. The CoronaVirus Patent from Emeryville's Chiron Corp is also there. Thats where i married Erika, Alameda County and i did not know she had a past in Prositituibn. Baptism washes away all the sins... I never thought id be a victim! [LaReina](https://archive.org/details/lareinalosangele00hill) is a book of Losangles history, but it starts in 1929 it was written by a financial institution and it omits the presence of Agriculture, like the Citrus groves of beverlyhills! The Egyptian, that theater in hollywood, there is a shop across the street [Abyssinia Gifts from Africa](https://hollywoodpartnership.com/go/abyssinia-gifts-from-africa) that has a ton of architechtual clues to the takeover. Longs Peir was destroyed and others along the coast and history is constantly blotted out after sex parties! I put the Kingdom Hall in Avondale Estates up bc i knew a lot of women from there and Erika as well and I have to be prepared bc The Quran is their native book and after Sex trafficking folds i can expect 3-5 brides at once and i dont know what to do bc im being tortured for just knowing them and we are constantly growing in similar dierctions and need freedom to talk without being poisoned and stalked
