### NASA Wants to Identify Phytoplankton Species from Space. Here’s Why.



They’re small, but they’re mighty. From producing oxygen we breathe to soaking up carbon we emit to feeding fish we eat, tiny phytoplankton are a crucial part of ocean ecosystems and essential to life as we know it on Earth. To give us a new view of these extraordinary aquatic organisms, NASA is launching a satellite in early 2024.

Instruments on the PACE (short for Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem) satellite will peer down at the ocean and collect data on the colors of light reflecting off it, telling us where different types of phytoplankton are thriving. Ivona Cetinić, the Science Lead for Ocean Biogeochemistry for PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) describes the weird, wonderful and important world of phytoplankton and why it's important for the PACE mission to study these tiny creatures.

## RegEx 
[webrename](https://www.webrename.com/) <~ Bulk file renamer takes regex. I got stuck on [ricothaka.github.io/worknotes02](ricothaka.github.io/worknotes02) bc the scanner at LaPL central spits out horrible filenames. I found great images from Mariner for Robins Weather Chores. Its old but as time rolls on im understanding the fact that historical weather data can help you uinderstand the present
