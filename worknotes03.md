## Urban Heat Image
### Los Angeles 
![LOS ANGELES HEATWAVE](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/downloads/gallery/urbanheat/00116_LST_over_LA.jpg)
[Greater Los Angeles](https://lacounty.gov/emergency/) is a prime example of an urban heat island - cities and suburbs woven with heat-trapping concrete and asphalt that lead to warmertemperatures than nearby rural areas that have more vegetation. Bordered by mountains and the ocean, the Greater L.A. area encompasses suburbs andskyscrapers, with a dense population and disparities in green space. It includes several counties, tens of thousands of square miles, and more than18 million people, making it a compelling test bed for heat wave research.

Climate change and urban heat are together fueling different heat waves now. In the 20th century, most heat waves in L.A. were dry. However, humidevents have steadily increased in frequency and intensity since 1950 due in part to swelling moisture from the warming sea surface.

In their case study, JPL scientists compared two heat waves that affected the Greater Los Angeles area in the summer of 2020: a prolonged muggystretch in August and an extremely dry three-day spike in September. During the latter event, record-breaking temperatures soared over 120 degreesFahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in the San Fernando Valley - a densely populated portion of the city of Los Angeles - while scorching winds fanned adestructive wildfire in the nearby San Gabriel Mountains. For their study, recently published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology,the scientists used NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) data set - a reanalysis of historicalatmospheric observations. They found that both heat waves drove temperatures above the 90th percentile for the August-September climate record in L.A.Using advanced weather modeling, they simulated the heat waves and looked at their impacts across the region [Continue Reading](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/galleryimage_urban)

[https://www.laconservancy.org/](https://www.laconservancy.org/) has records of buildings that have really shallow websites. Its kinda like [USPTO](https://www.uspto.gov/) old perl sections. Its like a whole section of internet history wass disabled for [CoronaVirus (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 Data in PubChem)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/covid-19)

### [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_of_Justice_(Los_Angeles))
 The Hall of Justice in Los Angeles is located at 211 W. Temple Street in the Civic Center district of Downtown Los Angeles. It occupies the southern two-thirds of the block between Temple and First streets and between Broadway and Spring streets.

Built in 1925, it was together with Los Angeles City Hall the first two large buildings opened in what would over the following decades demolish and transform the late-19th-century Central Business District to a Civic Center of modern landmark buildings and plazas.

### NASA Wants to Identify Phytoplankton Species from Space. Here’s Why.



They’re small, but they’re mighty. From producing oxygen we breathe to soaking up carbon we emit to feeding fish we eat, tiny phytoplankton are a crucial part of ocean ecosystems and essential to life as we know it on Earth. To give us a new view of these extraordinary aquatic organisms, NASA is launching a satellite in early 2024.

Instruments on the PACE (short for Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem) satellite will peer down at the ocean and collect data on the colors of light reflecting off it, telling us where different types of phytoplankton are thriving. Ivona Cetinić, the Science Lead for Ocean Biogeochemistry for PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) describes the weird, wonderful and important world of phytoplankton and why it's important for the PACE mission to study these tiny creatures.
