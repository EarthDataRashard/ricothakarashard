I was given instructions in 2015 on how to care for my mission duties. Erika and Her boyfriend scheduled the adultery and abandoment around me losing access to employment, then she violently took our daughter from me and accused me of child molestation. She is/was a Jehovahs Witness, that cult originates in East Los Angeles. She was once a local that was called "[Crazy Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIRxStt5jqI)" And Even if she is not directly acting againsty me. He partner in adultery stalks me and sabotages every attempt i make to contact [NASAJPL](https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/mrn/#/mars).

## Fine Free?
Rep karen. My managers at nasajpl new that erika was not helping with childcare or food or the search for a house and i gut destituted! Since then she has been in porn and i dont know her psychological makeup. The Library System makes no attempts to work with me having no income. Can you help me openly network my team at nasajpl with the library and get my card clear for checking out books and a tech to go laptop. I have no communication. It makes Ted Ross look super stupid and possibly criminal # [SMART_LA](https://youtu.be/UzhxtDpYvoY?si=we3oE0ckHyw-PMmU)
>As of August 10, 2021, LA County Library has eliminated fines for overdue books and materials. As of this date, past, present, and future overdue fines for materials will no longer be charged. The burden of administrative fines and fees can create financial strain for low-income families and can contribute to a cycle of economic hardship. Recent actions statewide have brought to light the concept that administrative fees can have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable individuals, particularly youth, non-citizens, and people of color. For these reasons, more and many libraries around the country—and the world—are eliminating fines. LA County Library is happy to be a new member of fine free libraries.
