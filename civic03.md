Rep karen. My managers at nasajpl new that erika was not helping with childcare or food or the search for a house and i gut destituted! Since then she has been in porn and i dont know her psychological makeup. The Library System makes no attempts to work with me having no income. Can you help me openly network my team at nasajpl with the library and get my card clear for checking out books and a tech to go laptop. I have no communication. It makes Ted Ross look super stupid and possibly criminal # [SMART_LA](https://youtu.be/UzhxtDpYvoY?si=we3oE0ckHyw-PMmU)
>As of August 10, 2021, LA County Library has eliminated fines for overdue books and materials. As of this date, past, present, and future overdue fines for materials will no longer be charged. The burden of administrative fines and fees can create financial strain for low-income families and can contribute to a cycle of economic hardship. Recent actions statewide have brought to light the concept that administrative fees can have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable individuals, particularly youth, non-citizens, and people of color. For these reasons, more and many libraries around the country—and the world—are eliminating fines. LA County Library is happy to be a new member of fine free libraries.

### [The impact of COVID19 pandemic and government enforced lockdowns on levels of attendance and context of sexual assaults reported at Saint Marys Sexual Assault Referral Centre pdf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10245237/pdf/main.pdf)

[Intimate partner violence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10245237/#:~:text=Reports%20of%20intimate%20partner%20violence,in%20Peru%20increased%20by%2048%25) (IPV) is usually experienced by women by their partners and can take many forms including physical and sexual violence.30 Reports of intimate partner violence have increased at varying rates internationally during lockdowns in 2020 compared to the same months in 2019: there was a 23% increase of sexual and psychological violence reported in a survey of 13,786 people in Spain4; calls to a domestic violence helpline in Peru increased by 48%5; emergency calls from women about domestic violence in European Union States increased by 60%6 and domestic violence calls in the United States of America increased by 7.5%.7 Lockdown and economic stress as a result of COVID-19 has been attributed to the increase in IPV, lockdown in particular is considered to have increased incidences of psychological, physical and sexual abuse.4 Although lockdown measures may be temporary, the economic and financial stress felt because of the pandemic are likely to be long lasting and thus physical and sexual abuse increases are likely to have long-term impacts on individuals and services. These increases in IPV across the world highlight the need for services offering support to consider their current delivery to ensure all victims are supported in both the short- and long-term.
