Tar is so confusing. its just a few flags to do mosg things you need to do and of those '-t' i can never rememberbis the key to listing whats in a [tarball]() -c creates the tarball -x extracts -v gives verbosity! scrollinng through the man pages i saw so much potential to create masdive accessible data arcivrs like the host on archive.org. I wanted to tar up bash.md so when i upload ivto archive it will be the same or closer. i like origioanl files. Being the age i am the nft emotion makes sense but yhe market does not... its just laziness and mild retardation...
